**Alpha Versions**

There are two alphas before a beta, alpha-1 and alpha-2. Alpha-2 is more stable than alpha-1 but both are not intended for production use.
Feel free to use alphas when testing, just be careful.

**Beta Versions**

There are two betas before a release, beta-1 and beta-2. Like alpha-2, beta-2 two is more stable. It is not recommended to use betas for production, but not required to not use them.
Feel free to use betas for testing.

**Releases**

A release is a stable version that is intended for production use. They will update once a while.
